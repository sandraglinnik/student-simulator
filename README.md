Student Simulator.
Main file - game.py.

You need to satisfy the basic needs: energy, fullness, recreation and hygiene, maintain the perfomance and manage the finances of a virtual student.
You should avoid the decrease of any parameter, otherwise student might either die or get into trouble - in both cases you lose the game. The goal is to hold on as long as you can.
